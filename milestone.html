        </h1>
        <p><b>
            Climate change is expected to make it more challenging in the future to meet air pollution standards, which are designed to protect public health. Air pollutants and greenhouse gases – chiefly from energy use in transportation, agricultural, residential and industrial activities – contribute directly to warming conditions and exacerbate the problem via secondary effects. 

Eligible candidates for the Women In Science Incentive Prize will be scientists with advanced degrees in the fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, environmental science or closely related fields; or entrepreneurs with advanced degrees who are creating science-based products and technology to help mitigate/reduce the impact of climate change</b></p>
Successful applicants will be addressing air quality through one of the following areas:

<p style="color:blue;">advanced monitoring and quantification–</p><b> of pollutant emissions at high spatial resolution; pollutant transport and transformation processes; innovative life cycle analysis.</b>
<p style="color:blue;">Secondary effects – .</p>wildfires, particulate matter, extreme heat and ozone.
<p style="color:blue;">Energy:</p><b>fossil alternatives, efficiency and conservation – in industrial, agriculture or urban settings; decarbonization.</b>
<p style="color:blue;">Transformative technology<p/><b>for remediation, reduction or prevention – greenhouse gas emissions reduction; technology substitution; carbon sequestration; advanced materials for climate change mitigation.
